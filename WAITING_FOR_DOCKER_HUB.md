# ⏳ Waiting for Docker Hub Recovery

**Status:** Docker Hub is currently experiencing a **503 Service Unavailable** outage  
**Impact:** Cannot pull base images (mysql:8.0, node:20-alpine, nginx:alpine)  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

---

## 🚫 Current Error

```
Error response from daemon: unknown: failed to resolve reference
"docker.io/library/mysql:8.0": failed to authorize: failed to fetch
oauth token: unexpected status from POST request to
https://auth.docker.io/token: 503 Service Unavailable
```

---

## ✅ What You Can Do Now

### **1. Check Docker Hub Status**

**Manual Check:**

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```

**Automated Check (use the scripts I created):**

```bash
# Windows
./check-docker-hub.bat

# Linux/Mac
./check-docker-hub.sh
```

**Online Status Pages:**

- https://status.docker.com/
- https://downdetector.com/status/docker/
- Twitter: @DockerStatus

---

### **2. Wait and Retry Periodically**

Set a reminder to retry every 30-60 minutes:

```bash
# Simple retry command
docker-compose up -d --build
```

---

### **3. Use Alternative Registry (Advanced)**

If you need to proceed urgently, see `ALTERNATIVE_REGISTRIES.md` for options.

**Quick alternative:**
Try using Quay.io mirror for MySQL:

```yaml
# Edit docker-compose.yml temporarily
image: quay.io/mysql/mysql-server:8.0
```

Then rebuild:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

⚠️ **Note:** Not recommended for production. Wait for official Docker Hub if possible.

## 🔄 When Docker Hub is Back Online

Once Docker Hub recovers, simply run:

```bash
# Quick build
docker-compose up -d --build

# Or use the automated script
./docker-build.bat
```

**Expected build time:** 3-5 minutes  
**Result:** All 3 containers running (frontend, backend, database)

---

## 🎯 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check if Docker Hub is available
docker pull hello-world

# Check current status
docker-compose ps

# View what images you have
docker images

# When Docker Hub is back, build everything
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs after build
docker-compose logs -f
```

---

## 📊 What Will Happen When You Build

1. **Frontend** (2-3 min)

   - Pull `node:20-alpine` for build stage
   - Install npm dependencies
   - Build React app with Vite
   - Pull `nginx:alpine` for runtime
   - Copy built files to Nginx

2. **Backend** (1-2 min)

   - Pull `node:20-alpine`
   - Install npm dependencies
   - Copy TypeScript source code
   - Configure for tsx runtime

3. **Database** (30 sec)
   - Pull `mysql:8.0` image (~1GB)
   - Initialize with SQL scripts
   - Create database and user

**Total:** 3-5 minutes

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **During the Wait:**

1. ✅ Review and update your `.env` file with secure credentials
2. ✅ Read through the documentation files
3. ✅ Plan what you'll test once containers are running
4. ✅ Check your code for any last-minute changes

### **Prepare for Success:**

```bash
# Make sure .env is configured
cat .env

# Ensure ports are free
netstat -ano | findstr ":80 :8000 :3308"

# Check disk space
docker system df
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: All images were removed**

**Cause:** You ran `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)` which removed containers, but images were also cleaned up  
**Solution:** Will need to rebuild from scratch when Docker Hub is back

### **Issue: Port 3306 conflict**

**Status:** Already fixed in docker-compose.yml  
**Current config:** Using port 3308 instead

### **Issue: Health checks showing unhealthy**

**Status:** Fixed in frontend/Dockerfile (changed wget to curl)  
**Will be resolved:** On next successful build

## 📞 What to Do If Docker Hub Stays Down

If Docker Hub outage persists for hours:

1. **Check if it's a local network issue:**

   ```bash
   ping hub.docker.com
   curl https://hub.docker.com/
   ```

2. **Try alternative DNS:**

   - Configure Docker Desktop to use Google DNS (8.8.8.8)

3. **Use alternative registry** (see ALTERNATIVE_REGISTRIES.md)

4. **Consider postponing** and retry later

---

## ✅ Success Criteria (When Build Works)

You'll know the build succeeded when you see:

```bash
$ docker-compose ps

NAME               STATUS
medsync-frontend   Up (healthy)
medsync-backend    Up (healthy)
medsync-db         Up (healthy)
```

Then access:

- Frontend: http://localhost
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- Database: localhost:3308

---

## 🎉 Next Steps (After Successful Build)

1. Test the application
2. Review logs for any errors
3. Update security credentials in `.env`
4. Document any custom configurations
5. Celebrate! 🎊

**Current Status:** ⏳ Waiting for Docker Hub recovery  
**Action Required:** Periodically retry `docker-compose up -d --build`  
**ETA:** Unknown (depends on Docker Hub recovery time)

**Stay patient!** Docker Hub outages typically resolve within a few hours.
