- **Transaction Safety**: All critical operations wrapped in transactions

### Backend Layer (Node.js/TypeScript/Express)

#### Models (9 files)
1. `appointment_extended.model.ts` - Appointment scheduling and management
2. `invoice.model.ts` - Billing and payment operations
3. `insurance.model.ts` - Insurance policy and claims
4. `prescription.model.ts` - Prescriptions and treatment recording
5. `reports.model.ts` - All 5 management reports
6. Plus existing: patient, doctor, staff, branch, user, treatment, speciality, medication, medical_history

#### Handlers (9 files)
1. `appointment_extended.handler.ts` - Appointment API endpoints
2. `invoice.handler.ts` - Billing API endpoints
3. `insurance.handler.ts` - Insurance API endpoints
4. `prescription.handler.ts` - Prescription API endpoints
5. `reports.handler.ts` - Report API endpoints
6. Plus existing handlers for all other entities

#### Router (router.ts)
- **35+ New Routes**: Complete RESTful API
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Proper authorization for each endpoint
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE appropriately used

### API Endpoints

#### New Endpoints (35+)
- **Appointments**: 7 endpoints (create, update, reschedule, get, slots, walk-in, branch-date)
- **Billing**: 5 endpoints (create invoice, get invoice, record payment, get payments, outstanding)
- **Insurance**: 6 endpoints (create, list, link patient, get patient policies, create claim, get claims)
- **Prescriptions**: 4 endpoints (create, get, record treatment, get treatments)
- **Reports**: 5 endpoints (all required management reports)

#### Existing Endpoints (30+)
- Authentication, Users, Doctors, Patients, Branches, Staff, Specialties, Treatments, Medical History, Medications, Logs

## Database Design Highlights

### ACID Properties Guaranteed
1. **Atomicity**: Transactions for multi-step operations
2. **Consistency**: Foreign keys and constraints enforced
3. **Isolation**: Stored procedures prevent race conditions
4. **Durability**: All changes persisted to database

### Key Relationships
```
User (1) → (1) Patient/Doctor/Staff
Patient (1) → (N) Appointments
Doctor (1) → (N) Appointments
Appointment (1) → (1) Invoice
Appointment (1) → (N) Treatments
Invoice (1) → (N) Payments
Patient (N) → (N) Insurance (via patient_insurance)
Treatment → Treatment_Catalogue (service codes)
```

### Constraints & Validations
- **No overlapping appointments** for same doctor
- **Positive amounts** for fees and payments
- **Valid status transitions** for appointments
- **Referential integrity** across all tables
- **Unique constraints** on service codes, usernames, etc.

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Interfaces for all data models
- **IDE Support**: Auto-completion and error detection
- **Maintainability**: Clear contracts between layers
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting code

### Error Handling
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: All async operations wrapped
- **Meaningful Messages**: Clear error responses
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Proper REST conventions
- **Logging**: Console errors for debugging

### Code Organization
```
backend/
├── src/
│   ├── models/        # Data access layer (9 files)
│   ├── handlers/      # Business logic layer (9 files)
│   ├── router/        # API routing (1 file)
