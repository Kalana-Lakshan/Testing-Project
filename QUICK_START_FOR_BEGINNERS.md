# 🎯 SUPER SIMPLE: 3 Steps to Dockerize MedSync

**For absolute beginners who just want it to work!**

---

## ⚡ The 3 Magic Commands

### **Step 1: Check You're Ready**

```bash
./check-prerequisites.bat
```

**What you should see:**  
✅ Docker Desktop is installed  
✅ Docker is running  
✅ docker-compose is available

---

### **Step 2: Wait for Docker Hub (CURRENT BLOCKER)**

```bash
./check-docker-hub.bat
```

**Keep running this until you see:**  
✅ Docker Hub is ONLINE!

**Current status:** ⚠️ Docker Hub is DOWN (not your fault!)  
**What to do:** Check every 30-60 minutes until it's back

---

### **Step 3: Build Everything (When Docker Hub is online)**

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

**Wait 3-5 minutes**, then:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**You should see all containers "Up (healthy)"**

---

## 🌐 **Step 4: Use Your App**

Open in browser: **http://localhost**

That's it! Your MedSync is now running in Docker! 🎉

---

## 🛠️ **Daily Commands**

```bash
# Start your app
docker-compose up -d

# Stop your app
docker-compose down

# Check if running
docker-compose ps

# View logs if something's wrong
docker-compose logs -f
```

---

## 🚨 **If Something Goes Wrong**

```bash
# Restart everything
docker-compose restart

# Fresh start
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build

# View error messages
docker-compose logs
```

## ❓ **FAQs**

**Q: Why isn't it building?**  
A: Docker Hub is currently down (503 error). Wait for it to recover.

**Q: How do I know when Docker Hub is back?**  
A: Run `./check-docker-hub.bat` - it will tell you!

**Q: How long will it take to build?**  
A: 3-5 minutes the first time, faster after that.

**Q: Where is my website?**  
A: http://localhost (after containers are running)

**Q: How do I stop it?**  
A: `docker-compose down`

**Q: Will stopping it delete my code?**
